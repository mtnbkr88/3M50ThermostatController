# 3M50ThermostatController
Android App to control a 3M50 Radio Thermostat.

In December 2022 Radio Thermostat Company of America announced "On May 15, 2023, the Radio Thermostat mobile app is being discontinued and you will no longer be able to control your thermostat with internet connected devices." So I created the 3M50ThermostatController Android app found here as a replacement. It is free for personal use. 

Version 1.1 adds option for Celsius or Fahrenheit.

Version 1.2 adds option to sync Thermostat time to phone time.
